-- MARG-AI — Supabase schema
--
-- This file is the version-controlled source of truth for the Supabase project
-- referenced in index.html (SUPABASE_URL / SUPABASE_ANON_KEY near the top of <head>).
-- It was written by reading the live schema directly from the project (ap-south-1 /
-- Mumbai, project ref mpfzxbvpndextzgiqpmo) — it matches what's actually deployed,
-- not an aspirational design. Keep this file and the live database in sync: any
-- schema change made through the Supabase dashboard or `apply_migration` should be
-- reflected back here in the same commit.
--
-- Safe to re-run: every statement is idempotent (IF NOT EXISTS / CREATE OR REPLACE).

-- ============================================================================
-- usage_events — anonymous, insert-only product analytics.
--
-- Logged from the client via trackEvent() (see index.html). Each row is tied only
-- to a random per-browser id (anon_id), never to a name, email or other identifying
-- detail — see the in-app Privacy Policy. There is deliberately no SELECT/UPDATE/
-- DELETE policy for the public/anon role: the client can only ever insert new rows,
-- never read, edit or remove existing ones. Only service-role access (dashboard,
-- SQL editor, or a future admin-only backend) can query this table.

-- anon_id and event_name are both non-empty and no longer than 64 characters — this
-- bounds what a malicious client could stuff into the table, without needing any
-- server-side validation layer. No SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE policy exists for this role
-- by design, so the client genuinely cannot read back analytics data, even its own.

    );

-- Useful ad-hoc queries (run these in the Supabase SQL editor, not from the client —
-- there's no policy allowing the client to read this table):
--
--   -- events per day
--   select date_trunc('day', created_at) as day, count(*)
--   from usage_events group by 1 order by 1 desc;
--
--   -- most common events
--   select event_name, count(*) from usage_events group by 1 order by 2 desc;

-- user_data — one row per signed-in user, holding everything that used to live
-- only in localStorage: saved careers/exams/colleges, checklist progress, and
-- profile (stage/location/budget). A single JSONB blob per user rather than
-- separate tables — simpler to build and migrate, at the cost of not being
-- able to query individual saved items from SQL. Revisit if that's ever needed.
--
-- Requires a signed-in user (auth.uid()) — there is no anonymous/guest access
-- to this table at all, unlike usage_events. A visitor who isn't signed in
-- keeps using localStorage exactly as before; this table only exists for
-- someone who has created a real account (see index.html's auth code).

-- NOTE: this table only holds app data, not the account itself. Deleting a
-- user's Supabase Auth account (not just this row) needs a service-role call
-- — the anon key the client uses can never do that — so a real "delete my
-- account" feature needs a server-side function (e.g. a Supabase Edge
-- Function) added later. Not built yet; flagging so it isn't assumed to work.

-- ============================================================================
-- Not yet built: the "decision room" feature referenced in index.html's Supabase
-- comment (a shared space for a student + parent to plan together) has no tables
-- here because it was never implemented — only commented as an intended future
-- use of this Supabase project. When/if that's built, its schema (likely a `rooms`
-- table + membership + RLS scoped to room participants, probably with Realtime
-- enabled) belongs in this file alongside usage_events, not as a separate file.
